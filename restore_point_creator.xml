The types are "release", "candidate", and "beta". The "betaRCVersion" node
is only used in the "beta" channel and is used to tell the user if it's a
public beta or release candidate. The standard string used in it is
"Public Beta X" and "Release Candidate X" with X being the number.
The "tom" channel is a private channel for use by the developer only
for testing purposes.
